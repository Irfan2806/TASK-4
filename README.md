SQL Data Extraction, Analysis & Optimization

## Objective
To practice and perform essential SQL operations for data retrieval, analysis, and optimization in a relational database environment.

---
### ✅ 1. SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- Retrieved specific data from tables.
- Applied filtering conditions.
- Sorted data in ascending and descending order.
- Grouped records to generate summarized results.

### ✅ 2. Performed SQL Joins
- Used **INNER JOIN** to retrieve matching records between tables.
- Used **LEFT JOIN** to include all records from the left table with matched records from the right.
- Used **RIGHT JOIN** to include all records from the right table with matched records from the left.

### ✅ 3. Wrote Subqueries
- Retrieved data using nested queries.
- Used subqueries inside `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses for conditional filtering.

### ✅ 4. Used Aggregate Functions
- Performed summarization using:
  - `SUM()` for total calculations
  - `AVG()` for average values
  - Also utilized `COUNT()` and `MAX() / MIN()` where applicable.

### ✅ 5. Created Views for Analysis
- Designed a **database view** to simplify repeated reporting queries.
- View helps in analyzing:
  - Total orders
  - Total amount spent
  - Average order value per customer

### ✅ 6. Query Optimization with Indexes
- Added indexes on frequently-used columns.
- Improved efficiency of `JOIN` and `WHERE` conditions.
- Enhanced overall query execution performance.
